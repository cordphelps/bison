### Public appreciation of species diversity: Swiss findings and comparison with intuitions from the 2017 re-introduction of *B. bison* in western Canada 


ABSTRACT 

Are biodiversity and aesthetics valued separately by the public? Does public appreciation for biodiversity and aesthetics manifest itself outside of Switzerland? 

We examine news coverage regarding the recent re-introduction of B. bison into western Canada to compare apparent public valuation of both “biodiversity” and “aesthetics” with the Junge’s enhanced field margin studies.
